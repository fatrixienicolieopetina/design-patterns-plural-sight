Bridge Pattern
Concepts
	- Decouple abstraction and implementation
	- Encapsulation, composition and inheritance
	- Changes in the abstraction wont affect the client
	- One reason for using this pattern is details wont be right to begin with
	- Examples in Java are drivers jdbc
Design
	- Interface and abstract classes
	- Composition over inheritance
	- More than composition
	- Expect change from both sides
	- UML diagram includes abtraction, implementor, refined abstraction, concrete implementor
Pitfalls
	- Increases complexity
	- Conceptually difficult to plan
	-
